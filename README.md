# Recipe Recommender System

This is an implementation of a simple content- and user-based recommender system for recipes in Python with and additional Flask-API to be deployed in a Docker-environment. 

## Requirements

* Flask
* Flask-RESTful
* pandas
* NumPy

## Usage

This repo as a whole is currently not in working state. Please refrain from trying to deploy this repo as-is, since the original database is missing.
The individual Python-files in the recommender-folder should be without issues if used in combination with another database.
